# Message Generator 
## Project Description
This is a program that I have designed which will display a random message each time the program is run.

## How It Works
The program works by taking one randomly selected word from a number of arrays and then joining them together to make a sentence.

## Step By Step Plan
    step 1 - create several arrays containing the framework of a message

    step 2 - write a function which will select one word from each array using Math.Random

    step 3 - push the selected word from each array into a new empty array, in order

    step 4 - use the join function to display the new Array as a sentence
